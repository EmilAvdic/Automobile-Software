    <h1>Automotive Electronics and IT</h1>
    <p>Automotive electronics and IT are quickly changing. Multimodal mobility is connecting previously separated domains such as 
    cars and public transportation. Mobility‐oriented services such as car sharing are creating ecosystems and business models far from the 
    classic buy‐your‐own‐car approach. Autonomous driving demands highly interactive services with multisensor fusion—far from the currently deployed functionally 
    isolated control units. Connectivity and infotainment are transforming cars into distributed IT systems with cloud access over‐the‐air functional upgrades,
    high‐bandwidth access to map services, media content, other vehicles, and the surrounding infrastructure. Energy efficiency is evolving the classic powertrain 
    toward high‐voltage hybrid and electric engines.

    <p>One indicates the rapid growth of software‐driven innovations, along with a forecast for the near future. Complexity is growing fast—in some cases, 
    beyond what can be controlled, as recent security attacks have shown.</p>

    <h2>Complexity of Electronics</h2>
        <p>Electronics and software are the basis for new functions in the vehicle. The variety of functions and the share of the vehicle software in the
        Automotive electronics rise. This increases the complexity of the system and software architectures in the car. Also the number of custom
        Equipment variants make the systems more complex. Today's vehicles have more than 100 control units in which computer programs control certain vehicle functions.</p>

        <h2>Vehicle electronics in five clusters</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Powertrain & Chassis</li>

            <li>Advanced driver assistance systems</li>

            <li>Infotainment with navigation, radio or telephone</li>

            <li>Comfort such as light or a central locking system</li>

            <li>Infrastructure such as security or routing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Software-architectures for modern vehicle development</h2>

        <p>Ever since software found its way into cars, the initiative has been campaigning for an open and standardized system architecture in the automotive sector.
        In 2004, the first version of the standard, which is now combined under the Classic platform, was published and continuously expanded and improved in the 
        years that followed.The system and software architectures in vehicles must take this trend into account. They are subject to new requirements such as flexibility, 
        energy efficiency and robustness.</p>
