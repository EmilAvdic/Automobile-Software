    <h1>Automotive Electronics and IT</h1>
    <p>Automotive electronics and IT are quickly changing. Multimodal mobility is connecting previously separated domains such as 
    cars and public transportation. Mobility‐oriented services such as car sharing are creating ecosystems and business models far from the 
    classic buy‐your‐own‐car approach. Autonomous driving demands highly interactive services with multisensor fusion—far from the currently deployed functionally 
    isolated control units. Connectivity and infotainment are transforming cars into distributed IT systems with cloud access over‐the‐air functional upgrades,
    high‐bandwidth access to map services, media content, other vehicles, and the surrounding infrastructure. Energy efficiency is evolving the classic powertrain 
    toward high‐voltage hybrid and electric engines.

    <p>One indicates the rapid growth of software‐driven innovations, along with a forecast for the near future. Complexity is growing fast—in some cases, 
    beyond what can be controlled, as recent security attacks have shown.</p>
