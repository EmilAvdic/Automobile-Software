        <h2>Software in the car – the new cubic capacity</h2>
        <p>The automobile of modernity is a moving data center whose capabilities are largely determined by software and electronics.
        In the new Cross-Domain Computing Solutions division, Bosch will play an active role in shaping this paradigm shift.
        Employee Johanna Michelfelder explains what excites her about working in the new department
        and what goals it is pursuing there.</p>

        <h2>100 million lines of software code</h2>
        <p>A normal car now contains 100 million lines of software code – that is
        ten times more than ten years ago.</p>

        <h2>The market for automotive software is growing</h2>
        <p>Ten years ago there were still around ten million lines of software code
        integrated into a car, there are now around 100 million lines.
        The software for automated vehicles will even contain between 300 and 500 million lines of code.
        The number of software-intensive electronic systems in cars is therefore continuing to increase. “The market for such systems will
        grow by 15 percent annually until 2030,” says Hartung.
        But even if IT and automotive technology merge,
        remains a difference that is as simple as it is momentous: a smartphone can crash, but not have an accident – the car can.
        It moves equally in data and road traffic. "Especially when it comes to networked driving, 'safety first' applies," says Hartung.</p>
